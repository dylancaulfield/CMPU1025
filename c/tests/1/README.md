The Fibonacci series is a mathematical series of numbers as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,â€¦  

The series is calculated as: The sum of the current number and the previous number
produces the next number.

Write a C program to implement the Fibonacci series. Your program must implement
the following:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of terms in the series to display.
2. Display all the numbers in the Fibonacci series up to the term entered in
part 1 above.
3. Your program must continuously run and should only end when the user
selects an option to end the program. For example, when you run your
program, it may display:  
The Fibonacci series program  
Enter your selection:
1. Enter the number of terms to display in the sequence.
2. End Program
